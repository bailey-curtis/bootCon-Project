# Configuring and Executing Gophish - bootCon Project

This week, I completed a project on a cybersecurity topic of my choosing and presented it to the class at the cyber class conference, bootCon.

As I worked on the following project, I completed a Google Slides which I used throughout my presentation and presented a short, live, in-lass demonstration on the topic of my choosing.

<br>
I chose to do my project on Gophish, an open source phishing framework tool used by cyber professionals to test the security exposure of companies and their employees.

<br>
Within the following repositiory you will find my final slides deliverables as well as a brief recorded demonstration outlining how to use the tool within a live scenario.
